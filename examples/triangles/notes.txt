rules:
	punch your opponent in the face once to win the round
	win X rounds to win a match

moves per hand:
	punch - joystick up
		from bi jong: straight punch (chun choy), brings player into trapping range
		from trapping range, pak sao (executing or receiving): chun choy
		from trapping range, after executing lop sao: vertical backfist (lau sin choy) or horizontal backfist (gwa choy)
		from trapping range, after receiving lop sao: chun choy
		from bi jong, after executing lop sao: backfist or chun choy
	pak sao (deflect via slap) - joystick inward (towards real-life centerline)
		must be used against opposite hand - i.e., right hand must pak left hand
	lop sao (deflect via pull) - joystick outward (away from real-life centerline)
		must be used against same hand - i.e., right hand must lop right hand

	POSSIBLE SPECIAL MOVE:
	counter lop sao punch - joystick up immediately after receiving pak sao
		this must be with the same hand that executed the failed punch - i.e., right hand must punch again after being pak'd
		automatically executes both the lop sao and the backfist
		can only be countered with another lop sao, thus potentially leading to a "lop sao loop"
		slower than either hitting or pak'ing with the free hand, so should only be used to mix up your tactics
		requires more precise timing than other moves

ranges:
	1. both players in punching range (bi jong)
		possible names: punching range, full range
	2. one player in trapping range, one in punching range
		possible names: half range
	3. both players in trapping range
		possible names: trapping range, close range
