====

Lass is an object/component model for the Love2D open-source game engine. The object/component paradigm, inspired by the Unity engine, treats each game object as a modular set of customizable behaviours ("components") as opposed to an instance of a single class. Thus, it also treats a game as a serializable data structure of game objects. This allows one to mix and match existing components to create entirely new objects and prefabs.

The eventual goal of this project is to create a full-featured game development toolkit that is both accessible and extensible for developers at all skill levels.

Example projects coming soon.
