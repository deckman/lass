DEFINITIONS

"Source code" refers to any collection of human-readable, human-writable computer instructions that results in a software program.

"Binary form" refers to any non-human-readable files that are generated through the act of compiling, compressing, embedding, or encrypting source code.

"This software" refers to the source code to which this license has been applied. It also refers to the binary form of this source code, except in cases where the binary form was partly generated from source code not bound by this license; in such a case, the binary form is considered an example of a "work that contains this software". If these license terms are located within a single source code file, it can be assumed that this software consists only of the contents of that source file (other than the license terms) unless stated otherwise. These license terms can only be applied to source code or to the binary form of source code.

"You" and "your" refer to any entity exercising the rights of this license.

"The modified software" refers to any version of this software that was modified by you. Any reference to "this software" also applies to the modified software.
